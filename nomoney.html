			<p> Bengals are currently struggling with their money as they are -3million dollars in cap space. The way they manage their players contracts are bad to which influences their players to leave. They are currently paying what I think is there star player which is A.J. Green 13 million, as being one of the top 5 wide recievers in the leauge that is too low.
