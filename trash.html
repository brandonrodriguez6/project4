			<p>Aj Green in the orange and black jersey only had 161 more yards that JuJu smith-schuster which is a rookie for the Pitsburgh Steelers. This means that A.J. Green their "SuperStar" is barley getting more yards than a rookie. JuJu also has less REC(Catches) than A.J. Green as Green had 75 REC, JuJu had 58 REC.</P>

			<p>Andy Dalton their quarter back is not so good of a quarterback. his completion rate 59%, Interceptions 12, Yards per play 6.7, and 3,320 total yards. This is bad because Andy Dalton is not even avrageing a first down on the first play. Compared to the Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger his stats are, 64.2% completion rate, 7.6 yards per play, and 4,251 per play.

			<p>The Cincinnati Bengals have no developing rookies and no star player that they could rely to carry them. John Ross had an alright season but still did not show any superstar potential. Their first round pick last year William Jackson III only had one interception in the whole season (Pictured above talking to teammate).</p>
